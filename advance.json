      "content": "Derivatives are financial contracts whose value is derived from an underlying asset such as a stock, index, commodity, currency, or bond. They allow market participants to transfer risk, speculate on price movements, or lock in prices for future transactions. The two most common exchange-traded derivatives are futures and options. \n\nA futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price on a future date. Both parties are obligated to complete the transaction. An option is a right, but not an obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the underlying asset at a fixed price before or on a specific date. Derivatives can magnify returns but also magnify losses, so understanding how they work is essential before using them.",

      "content": "A call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a preset price (the strike) before or on expiry. Buyers of calls are bullish: they expect prices to rise. A put option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying at the strike before or on expiry. Buyers of puts are bearish: they expect prices to fall or want protection. \n\nOption buyers pay a premium and have limited risk (the premium) with potentially large upside. Option sellers (writers) receive the premium but take on potentially large risk if the market moves against them. Understanding strike price, expiry, lot size, and premium behavior is the foundation of options trading.",

      "topic": "Option Pricing (Premium, Intrinsic & Time Value, Greeks basics)",
      "content": "An option’s premium is the price paid by the buyer to the seller. It contains two parts: intrinsic value and time value. Intrinsic value reflects how much an option is in-the-money (e.g., a call with spot above strike). Time value reflects the potential for the option to gain value before expiry based on time and volatility. As expiry approaches, time value decays (theta decay). \n\nOption Greeks measure sensitivity: Delta shows how much the option price moves for a ₹1 change in the underlying; Gamma shows how Delta changes; Theta measures time decay; Vega captures sensitivity to volatility; and Rho shows sensitivity to interest rates. Beginners should focus on Delta and Theta first, then add Vega and Gamma as they gain experience.",

      "topic": "Options Trading Strategies (Covered Call, Straddle, Strangle, Iron Condor)",
      "content": "Options can be combined to create structured payoffs. A covered call involves holding the stock and selling a call to earn premium, reducing downside slightly and capping upside. A long straddle (buy call + buy put at the same strike) bets on big movement in either direction. A long strangle buys out-of-the-money call and put—cheaper than a straddle but needs a larger move. \n\nAn iron condor sells an out-of-the-money call spread and an out-of-the-money put spread simultaneously, profiting if the underlying stays in a range. Strategy choice depends on your view of direction and volatility, your risk tolerance, and your capital. Always define maximum risk before entering multi-leg strategies.",

      "content": "Futures are standardized contracts to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a future date. Index futures (like Nifty futures) allow trading the market as a whole; stock futures allow directional bets on individual companies. Futures require margin—a good-faith deposit—to open positions, and they are marked-to-market daily, which means profits and losses are settled every day. \n\nBecause of leverage, small price moves can lead to large profit or loss. Futures are used for speculation, hedging (e.g., protecting a portfolio), and arbitrage (capturing price differences). Traders must monitor margin requirements and be prepared for sharp moves, especially near events and expiries.",

      "content": "Hedging uses derivatives to reduce risk in an existing position. For example, a portfolio manager might buy index puts to protect against market declines or sell futures to lock in gains. The goal is not to make profit from the hedge itself but to cushion the portfolio from adverse moves. \n\nSpeculation uses derivatives to express a view on direction or volatility with less capital than buying the underlying. While leverage can boost returns, it also increases downside risk. A disciplined approach, position sizing, and predefined exits are essential for both hedgers and speculators.",

      "content": "Margin allows you to trade with borrowed money from your broker, increasing position size relative to your capital. Leverage magnifies both gains and losses; a 1–2% move in the underlying can translate to much larger swings in your equity. Exchanges and brokers set initial and maintenance margin requirements, and if your equity falls below maintenance margin, you may face a margin call or forced liquidation. \n\nUse leverage cautiously. Define maximum loss per trade, use stop losses, and avoid concentrating too much capital in a single leveraged position—especially around earnings or macro events.",

If the price falls, you profit from the difference; if it rises, losses can be unlimited because a stock price has no ceiling. \n\nShort selling carries special risks such as short squeezes (rapid price spikes as short sellers rush to cover), borrowing costs, and regulatory restrictions. It is generally recommended only for experienced traders with strict risk controls.",
